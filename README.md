# genealogic-tree-v2

A toy family tree chart using FLTK. 

Inspired by [genealogical-tree](https://github.com/wandagarbocz/genealogical-tree), a fairly clever chart showing 4 generations, including
cousins, siblings, and children. For more details on this, see the [wiki](https://github.com/fire-eggs/genealogic-tree-v2/wiki/%22Drzewo-genealogiczne%22---the-inspiration).
